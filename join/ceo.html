        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>Key responsibilities are to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Help to set and lead the strategic direction for Cogent.</li>
          <li>Drive commercial success, toward company goals.</li>
          <li>Develop a thriving company culture: a stimulating and enjoyable place to work.</li>
          <li>Build awareness and engagement with customers and communities.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>Here's hoping you match up to this key experience list:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Well honed leadership style, capable of building high-performing teams, creating passion, positive energy and forward movement.</li>

          <li>Entrepreneurial successes under the belt, ideally in successful digital startups.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You'll be frank by habit; prefer to have a go and adapt than worry about failure; like saying "yes, and" to new ideas; collaborate often; and
          enjoy walking out the door at a reasonable time to set a genuine life-centric example.
        </p>
        <p>We'll offer a competitive package, a share of profit as a long-term incentive, and the opportunity to shape something you can be truly proud of.</p>
