            <h2>What’s the main responsibility?</h2>
            <p>Ultimately, the buck stops with you. If our customer sets us a goal (such as “increase sales conversion on our website”) then it’s up to you to make that happen.</p>
            <p>To do that, you’ll be expected to cultivate a great relationship with the primary customer representative, and to earn their trust by learning their business inside out. It’s with that insight and knowledge that you can guide the Cogent team to meet their goals.</p>
            <p>In practical terms, you need to have some solid experience to draw on. You will have:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Delivered multiple digital projects to market including to incept, guide and deliver.</li>
              <li>Examples of successful projects where the customer/business met their goals thanks to your work.</li>
              <li>At least 8 years in digital product-related roles.</li>
              <li>Worked in multiple industries, and can articulate challenges and demonstrate strategic thinking in a number of these.</li>
              <li>Been responsible for guiding user experience designers and developers, using agile methodologies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To add to the kit bag, you’ll be a good communicator, have high integrity, care genuinely about what the objective of the project is, and be confident learning and operating in new business domains.</p>

More importantly, we’ll provide a transparent positive workplace, a team that collaborates by habit, customer relationships that are open and honest, and great projects to work on that you can be proud of.</p>
