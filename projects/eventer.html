      <h1>Eventer</h1>
      <h2>Changing what it's like to watch an event you couldn't make it to.</h2>
      <p class='visit'>
        <a href='http://www.eventer.com/'>Visit Eventer</a>
      </p>
      <aside>
        <p>Eventer is a platform that lets users watch a speaker deliver a presentation. We like to think the special part is that it puts the viewer in control to flick between focus on the speaker, the presentation, or both.</p>
        <h1>Why bother?</h1>
        <p>Lots of organisations - universities, corporates, and conferences - pay good money to get talks recorded. After the event, these often languish on a DVD in a drawer, or are published on a platform that offers a poor experience (eg, seeing the slides complemented only by the speaker audio). We think that it’s worth a little extra cash to convert this existing investment of recording the presentation, to make it enjoyable to view afterward by those who weren’t able to be there.</p>
        <h1>How might this be used?</h1>
        <p>A few ideas spring to mind.</p>
        <h3>Conferences.</h3>
        <p>
          Share the talks with attendees afterward. People who went to one track can now view talks from another. Or those who couldn’t travel to the event can pay for a digital ticket to view from the comfort of home.
        </p>
        <h3>Organisations.</h3>
        <p>
          Spread the word of your leaders. Often senior people travel to main offices to deliver key messages, such as the quarterly result or strategy. Out of the way centres and customer-facing staff often can’t be reached by these. Create a private channel on Eventer, and share these messages with your staff at a time that suits their schedules.
        </p>
        <h3>Educators.</h3>
        <p>
          Push the didactic lecture content out to users prior to attending a class - and make better use of the face time for conversation, debate, and exploring challenging areas.

          thought of this first, but what a fine idea.
        </p>
        <h1>What we’re up to.</h1>
        <p>
          So far, Cogent has sketched and built a basic proof of concept. We’ve trialled one event - you can see it at
          <a href='http://ignitemelbourne.eventer.com'>Ignite Melbourne.</a>
          With plenty of positive feedback, the real work lies ahead to make a robust version to launch.
