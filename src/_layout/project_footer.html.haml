      %p We don't think about our skills as buzzwords like strategy, user experience, agile methods or Ruby on Rails development â€” we think about working as a team with your objective in mind.  
  
      %p We relish the challenge of creating something new, and to solve tough problems that haven't been solved before. We know that designing something that is efficient to run matters too, that's why we're also happy to be your ongoing support team.
