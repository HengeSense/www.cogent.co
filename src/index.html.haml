      %h2.focus Focus on outcomes
      %p Your business objective is what we get passionate about. Not awards, fancy design for no reason, or irrelevant shiny features. Lower cost to operate? Lift sales conversion? That'll be our focus.

    .principle.alt
      %h2.together In this together
      %p We believe great things happen when technology, design and business experts work openly and closely together. We spend lots of time with our customers. It helps us to produce what you wanted.

    .principle
      %h2.tools Pick the right tools for the job
      %p Our kit bag has lots of methods for shaping your project. We’ll pick the ones that suit your needs. We keep waste low and avoid rigid process or lengthy spec documents. We put our energy into iterating on real work, like sketches or software.

    .principle.alt
      %h2.learning Learn constantly
      %p Iterating is built into our DNA. We talk and share thinking in lightweight forms, seek feedback often, and adapt. We’ll be gluttons for knowledge about your business, as that gives us the best chance of creating a good result.
