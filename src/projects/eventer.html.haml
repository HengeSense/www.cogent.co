        %h2 Changing what it's like to watch an event you couldn't make it to.
        %p Eventer is a platform that lets users watch a speaker deliver a presentation. We like to think the special part is that it puts the viewer in control to flick between focus on the speaker, the presentation, or both.

      %h2.with-margin-top.dark-blue Great talks deserve a great big audience.
      %p Lots of organisations - universities, corporates, and conferences - pay good money to get talks recorded. After the event, these often languish on a DVD in a drawer, or are published on a platform that offers a poor experience (eg, seeing the slides complemented only by the speaker audio). We think that itâ€™s worth a little extra cash to convert this existing investment of recording the presentation, to make it enjoyable to view afterward by those who werenâ€™t able to be there.

        %h3 Conferences.
        %p
          Share the talks with attendees afterward. People who went to one track can now view talks from another. Or those who couldnâ€™t travel to the event can pay for a digital ticket to view from the comfort of home.
        %h3 Organisations.
        %p
          Spread the word of your leaders. Often senior people travel to main offices to deliver key messages, such as the quarterly result or strategy. Out of the way centres and customer-facing staff often canâ€™t be reached by these. Create a private channel on Eventer, and share these messages with your staff at a time that suits their schedules.
        %h3 Educators.
        %p
          Push the didactic lecture content out to users prior to attending a class - and make better use of the face time for conversation, debate, and exploring challenging areas.

        %p
          So far, Eventer has made great talks from events like 
          %a{:href => "http://ignitemelbourne.eventer.com"} Ignite Melbourne
          and
          %a{:href => "http://swipeconference.eventer.com"} Swipe Conference
          available to anyone with a web browser and an internet connection.
        %p
          Our next efforts are focused on integrating Eventer into a digital education platform to help reshape the delivery of online learning.
