        %p Under the hood, the product is a white-label hotel booking platform, running three distinct branded websites for Qantas, Jetstar and Hooroo. Each brand attracts different types of travellers, so each site is tailored in some way to appeal to that market.
        %h2.dark-blue.with-margin-top What happened?
        %p Cogent were involved from start to launch. Initially, we helped guide the development of the back-end systems for hotels to manage their inventory. On the public-facing side, Cogent were heavily involved in implementation of the user interface, front-end architecture, and many of the core backend components such as the booking and payments gateways.
